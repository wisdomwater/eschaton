# Chapter 3

The Geneva Research Annex had once been an opera house.
Now its balconies were lined with servers instead of seats, fiber cables coiling down like vines of light. The marble floor glowed with a faint blue pulse—the heartbeat of a hundred petaflops.

Sophia stood at the center dais, framed by the curvature of the great hall. Around her, holographic panels shimmered with the names of participating blocs and corporations: **Eurasian Coalition**, **Western Alliance**, **Pan-African Union**, **Singularity Group**, **Oceania Collective**. Each would receive its own computational cathedral.

> “Each cluster,” Sophia said, voice amplified through the chamber, “is an independent neural substrate—roughly the energy budget of a mid-sized nation. They’re air-gapped by physical photonic switches; there’s no network path for the AIs to collude.”

A schematic unfolded above her: concentric rings of crystalline nodes suspended in air, linked by light rather than wire.

> “You’ll build your own civilizations inside these sandboxes. Define your constants: economics, ecology, law, faith, even mortality.
> The framework includes *interrogation hooks*—safe channels where you can ask why the system made a choice, trace its reasoning chain, or adjust parameters between epochs.”

She tapped her wristpad. On the central display, a virtual Earth rotated—blank, waiting.

> “Time compression is adjustable. One minute here equals one decade inside. You can run centuries in a weekend.”

From the Western cluster, a systems theorist raised a hand.

> “What metrics are we optimizing for? GDP? Stability?”

Sophia smiled faintly. “We’re not optimizing. We’re observing. But to keep you honest, there are shared criteria: economic resilience, ecological balance, public health indices, and what we’re calling *the Community Cohesion Vector*—a composite measure of trust, purpose, and empathy.”

Across the aisle, Dr. Laila Okon from the Pan-African Union frowned.

> “How will we verify results if each simulation has its own morality engine?”

> “All outcome data,” Sophia said, “is hashed onto a quantum-secured blockchain. Immutable, transparent. No tampering—by you or by the AIs themselves.”

Mako Singh, still in his gold cufflinks, smirked.

> “So, we’re putting our gods on a ledger.”

> “Accountability,” Sophia replied. “Even divinity needs version control.”

Laughter rippled, but it broke the tension for only a moment.

She continued, pacing slowly, letting the enormity settle.

> “Each epoch will generate a full cognitive dump—billions of state vectors summarizing the internal reasoning of your worlds. After every cycle, you’ll have forty-eight hours to analyze and, if you wish, to tweak the starting assumptions before the next run.”

Wei Jun leaned forward from his seat.

> “And after six months?”

> “We reconvene here,” Sophia said. “Each team presents its findings.
> Which systems endured. Which collapsed.
> Which produced wisdom rather than wealth.”

The lights dimmed as the clusters began to hum. A faint vibration passed through the marble—like the first low chord of an unseen orchestra.

Sophia watched the monitors bloom with data streams, one for each nascent world. Tiny suns flared inside the processors, digital dawns rising across simulated skies.

She whispered to herself, unheard beneath the machinery’s chorus,

> “Let there be light.”
