The morning light in San Francisco looked like it had forgotten how to choose a color.
Sunrise bled through a sky the hue of oxidized copper, refracting off the bay in jittery flashes. From Sophia Kade’s window, the towers of the financial district shimmered like an array of misaligned mirrors, each one catching a different truth.

Her apartment was a study in contradictions—half monastery, half laboratory.
One wall held framed degrees: **Computer Science**, **Theology**, **Cognitive Psychology**—three attempts to understand creation, meaning, and the mind. Another wall was lined with terracotta pots, each nurturing a plant rescued from a lab experiment. A cat—grey, contemplative, named Pascal—watched her from the countertop with the mild reproach of an ancient philosopher.

Sophia ate standing up, a bowl of oatmeal cooling beside her tablet.
The apartment smelled of cinnamon, coffee, and ozone from the air purifier that never quite worked.

On her phone, the morning feeds scrolled past:
— *“Water War Escalates: Asian Bloc Accuses West of Weather Tampering.”*
— *“Western Grid Hack Retaliation: Officials Deny Cyberstrike.”*
— *“UN Confirms Data Fabrication in Climate Reports—But by Whom?”*

She switched apps, double-checking across networks—public, corporate, citizen streams. The same stories, inverted. In one, the East was villain; in another, the West. In a third, the war itself was “misinformation theatre.” Every feed bristled with proof, statistics, charts, confidence scores. None agreed.

Pascal leapt down, tail twitching. The sound startled her more than it should have.

Sophia set the phone aside and looked out across the waking city. On the horizon, drones traced new flight patterns, ferrying data pods to an orbital array. Somewhere in those metal minds, the truth had been lost in a recursive loop of its own making.

She thought of her first-year ethics students, years ago, debating whether more knowledge automatically led to better decisions. *Information isn’t wisdom,* she had told them. *Wisdom requires the humility to not need to be right.*

The world had not listened.

Her tablet chimed again—a breaking-news alert. Stock indexes spiking and crashing in the same minute. Two governments issuing contradictory nuclear warnings, both citing “verified intelligence.”

Sophia muted the sound. The silence felt heavier than the noise.

She picked up her mug, cradling the warmth in both hands, and whispered to no one in particular,

> “We’ve become omniscient without understanding. Maybe that’s what original sin looks like in code.”

Pascal blinked, unimpressed. Outside, the city’s power grids flickered; a brief darkness rolled over the skyline like a cloud’s shadow. When the lights returned, the billboard on the opposite tower displayed a new headline: **GLOBAL SYSTEMS COALITION CALLS EMERGENCY SESSION IN GENEVA.**

Sophia exhaled through her nose, slow and deliberate.
She already knew they’d call her. They always did when the machines started speaking in tongues.
